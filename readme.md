# Weewar Dashboard

I created this YEARS ago. I don't even remember the last time I used this.

Weewar is a fun little once-indy strategy game that gained so much noteriety that EA bought them out long ago. Seems like it's still going although it's hayday is long past. Still, it's a good game.

At the time, I was learning about all this "AJAX" stuff and "XML". Although I didn't apply AJAX here, I did use the Weewar API to learn API's, XML, and even HTTP.

I am thinking of revamping and updating it when I have time.
